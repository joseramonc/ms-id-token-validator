# MsIdTokenValidator

This library is provided to validate id token from Microsoft Oauth2.

Inspired from the [Google ID Token](https://github.com/google/google-id-token)

### Disclaimer
I am entirely not affiliated with Microsoft, the code is provided as-is and no warranty.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ms-id-token-validator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ms-id-token-validator

## Usage
    
```ruby
validator = MsIdToken::Validator.new

begin
  # audience is possibly the Application Client ID
  payload = validator.check(id_token, audience)
rescue MsIdToken::IdTokenExpired => ex
  puts 'Id token is expired'
end

```

By default, the public keys fetched from Microsoft are cached in one hour. Microsoft [state that](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-tokens) their public key should be updated within 24 hours, so our default value is more than enough.

To change the cached expiry, for example, 6 hours, we can pass the value at the time creating the validator.

```ruby
validator = MsIdToken::Validator.new({expiry: 6 * 3600})
```
